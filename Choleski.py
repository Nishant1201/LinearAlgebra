## Module Choleski
""" L = Choleski(A)
    Choleski decomposition : [L][L]transpose = [A]

    x = CholeskiSol(L,b)
    Solution phase of Choleski's decomposition method.
"""

"""
    The code below is implemented with the following observation:
    A[i,j] appears only in the formula for L[i,j]. 
    Therefore, once L[i,j] has been computed, A[i,j] is no longer needed.
    This makes it possible to write the elements of L over the lower triangular
    portion of A as they are computed. The elements above the
    leading diagonal of A will remain untouched.
    The function Choleski(A) implements Choleskiâ€™s decomposition.
    If a negative diagonal term is encountered during decomposition,
    an error message is printed and the program is terminated.
    After the coefficient matrix A has been decomposed, the solution of Ax = b can
    be obtained by the usual forward and back substitution operations. The function
    choleskiSol carries out the solution phase.
